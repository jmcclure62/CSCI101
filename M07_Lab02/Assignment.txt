Assignment:  Body Mass Index

Write a program that reads names, weights, and heights from BMI.dat (do not change the file name). 
Use the information to calculate and displays a person’s body mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used 
to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height. 
A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:

BMI = weight * 703 / height ^2, where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.

The file format is:  'name', 'weightInKG', 'heightInCM'

Steps:
Read the name, weight, and height for 4 people from the file
Convert the weights in the file to pounds (Note:  1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds)
Convert the heights in the file to inches (Note:  1 cm = 0.39 inches)
Display the person's name, their calculated BMI, and whether they are considered
		overweight, optimal, or underweight
		* overweight is above 25 BMI
		* optimal is between 18.5 and 25
		* underweight is below 18.5
Validate input:  heights and weights from the file MUST be greater than 0.
